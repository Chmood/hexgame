# TODO

## Known bugs

* [CRITICAL] Due to map parity lateral move (when flat-topped), some tile cannot be reached/selected
* Improve post-processing when camera switch (SSAO is fucked up)
* Most tanks are floating above the ground

## Improvements

* Makes diagonal cursor moves (2 arrow keys at the same time)
* Moving cursor with arrow keys should adapt to camera beta rotation
* Tank orientation (rotation on local Y axis) sometimes is sub-optimal (ex: 4/6th turn instead or 2/6th turn)

## Ideas
