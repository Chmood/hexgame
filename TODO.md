# TODO

## Known bugs

* [CRITICAL] Pointy map pathfinding is broken
* Moving cursor with arrow keys should adapt to camera beta rotation
* Due to map parity lateral move (when flat-topped), some tile cannot be reached/selected

## Improvements

* Make players have multiple units
* Animate player's movements (tile by tile)
* Makes diagonal cursor moves (2 arrow keys at the same time)
* Players can be on the same tile

## Ideas

* Clouds - See: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#ATDL99#0
* Boolean mesh - See: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#T6NP3F#0
* Animated skybox - See: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#E6OZX#122 and https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/sky
