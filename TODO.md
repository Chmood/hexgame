# TODO

## Known bugs

* [CRITICAL] Pointy map pathfinding is broken
* [CRITICAL] Sometimes ocean is valid tiles, findPath() is broken and so on...
* Moving cursor with arrow keys should adapt to camera beta rotation
* Due to map parity lateral move (when flat-topped), some tile cannot be reached/selected
* Players can be on the same tile

## Improvements

* Make players have multiple units
* Use two cameras, and let the user switch from one to another
* Makes diagonal cursor moves (2 arrow keys at the same time)

## Ideas

* Clouds - See: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#ATDL99#0
