# TODO

## Known bugs

* play bot function is broken
* Improve post-processing when camera switch (SSAO is fucked up)
* Tanks are floating above the ground, and their rotation doesn't follow the underneath tile

## Improvements

* Make bot attack too (seek & destroy mode)
* In-game menu
* Player can cancel a move while targetting (ala Fire Emblem)
* Disposing unit mesh still need love (one non-colored mesh remains)
* Improve Random Number Generator (https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom)
* Tank orientation (rotation on local Y axis) sometimes is sub-optimal (ex: 4/6th turn instead or 2/6th turn)
* Make all modules' methods (like module.method()) 'private' by default

## New features

* Let units attack each others
* Fullscreen mode
* Joypad support
