# TODO

## Known bugs

* Players can be on the same tile => keep map graph updated with units positions as high cost?
* Due to map parity lateral move (when flat-topped), some tile cannot be reached/selected
* Moving cursor with arrow keys should adapt to camera beta rotation
* Improve post-processing when camera switch (SSAO is fucked up)
* Most tanks are floating above the ground
* Tank orientation (rotation on local Y axis) sometimes is sub-optimal (ex: 4/6th turn instead or 2/6th turn)
* Tank move path sometimes differ from what was path-finded with the cursor

## Improvements

* Makes diagonal cursor moves (2 arrow keys at the same time)
