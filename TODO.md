# TODO

## Known bugs

* Players can be on the same tile => keep map graph updated with units positions as high cost?
* Due to map parity lateral move (when flat-topped), some tile cannot be reached/selected
* Moving cursor with arrow keys should adapt to camera beta rotation

## Improvements

* Use two cameras, and let the user switch from one to another
* Makes diagonal cursor moves (2 arrow keys at the same time)
* Tank orientation (rotation on local Y axis) sometimes is sub-optimal (ex: 4/6th turn instead or 2/6th turn)
* Tank move path sometimes differ from what was path-finded with the cursor
